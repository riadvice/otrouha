and assign the server you just created.

### Running unit tests

Unit tests can be ran in three ways

  * Without coverage : `./tools/opinion --test`
  * With code coverage : `../tools/opinion --test -c`
2. Using the web interface: Open run `./tools/opinion --enabletests` then
navigate the address http://otrouha.dev/?exam or
http://otrouha.dev/?exam=withCoverage to run with code coverage
3. Using command line
  * Show help, test suites that can be ran : `php public/index.php "/?exam&help"`
  * Without coverage : `php public/index.php "/?exam&cli&test=all"`
  * With code coverage : `php public/index.php "/?exam=withCoverage&cli&test=all"`
  * You can specify group of tests via test param : `php public/index.php "/?exam&cli&test=<group_name>"`
  * To get all group names : `php public/index.php "/?exam&cli"`

### Create a new migration

Writing migrations guide can be found at this link
http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/migrations.html

```sh
vendor/bin/phinx create SignificantMigrationName
```

### Running migrations

After creating a migration it can be ran using the command where "-e"
contains the environment name

```sh
vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e development
```

For rolling back a migration, use this carefully on development and
never use it in production, instead for production create new migrations
that fixes previous ones.

```sh
vendor/bin/phinx rollback -e development
```
